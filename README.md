The other component of EnterFace, the iOS app can be found at https://github.com/Kwang8/EnterFace

### What is it

The EnterFace ecosystem has three main components: the central database, a web-hosted map, and an iOS app with image classification model.
<br><br>
The database is using Google's Firebase platform. The database contains entries for each room in our building, keeping track of their current and max occupancies. Our web-hosted map and iOS app both interface with Firebase to update their client-side data in real-time.
<br><br>
The web-hosted app uses Google Maps' Javascript API to display the floorplan of the building. A marker is placed at each room, displaying the room name, its current capacity, and a picture of the room. The occupancy of each room is updated in real-time by pulling data from Firebase.
